Cron Expression :

<second> <minute> <hour> <day-of-month> <month> <day-of-week> <year> <command>

* (all) – it is used to specify that event should happen for every time unit. For example, “*” in the <minute> field – means “for every minute”
? (any) – it is utilized in the <day-of-month> and <day-of -week> fields to denote the arbitrary value – neglect the field value. For example, if we want to fire a script at “5th of every month” irrespective of what the day of the week falls on that date, then we specify a “?” in the <day-of-week> field
– (range) – it is used to determine the value range. For example, “10-11” in <hour> field means “10th and 11th hours”
, (values) – it is used to specify multiple values. For example, “MON, WED, FRI” in <day-of-week> field means on the days “Monday, Wednesday, and Friday”
/ (increments) – it is used to specify the incremental values. For example, a “5/15” in the <minute> field, means at “5, 20, 35 and 50 minutes of an hour”
L (last) – it has different meanings when used in various fields. For example, if it’s applied in the <day-of-month> field, then it means last day of the month, i.e. “31st for January” and so on as per the calendar month. It can be used with an offset value, like “L-3“, which denotes the “third to last day of the calendar month”. In the <day-of-week>, it specifies the “last day of a week”. It can also be used with another value in <day-of-week>, like “6L“, which denotes the “last Friday”
W (weekday) – it is used to specify the weekday (Monday to Friday) nearest to a given day of the month. For example, if we specify “10W” in the <day-of-month> field, then it means the “weekday near to 10th of that month”. So if “10th” is a Saturday, then the job will be triggered on “9th”, and if “10th” is a Sunday, then it will trigger on “11th”. If you specify “1W” in the <day-of-month> and if “1st” is Saturday, then the job will be triggered on “3rd” which is Monday, and it will not jump back to the previous month
# – it is used to specify the “N-th” occurrence of a weekday of the month, for example, “3rd Friday of the month” can be indicated as “6#3“
